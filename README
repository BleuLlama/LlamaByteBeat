Pre-reqs:
	- C compiler.  Duh.
	- Curses/NCurses (usually already installed)
	- PortAudio library installed properly
		http://www.portaudio.com/

Get all of that, then just type 'make'

You'll end up with some stuff:

	./simple	portAudio example modified to play a bytebeat tune
			no visualizer

	./lbb		the gold.  the curses-based app.

Currently, just type ./lb, and you'll see a tune displaying in it.

Future:

	./lbb glitch://song!aa!Ddad

or
	./lbb song!aa!Ddad
